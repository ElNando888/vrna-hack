The goal of this hack/fork is to implement ligand binding routines as properly
as possible (correct MFEs and partition functions)

See README.orig and http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/ for details about the
original package.

Example:
$ Progs/RNAfold --ligand FMN:200

will fold sequences assuming 200 uM of FMN in the solution.
